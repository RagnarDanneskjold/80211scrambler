80211scrambler is a small collection of tools in Verilog for working
with the 802.11B scrambler.  Understanding this scrambler is necessary
when doing PIP injections from a 2Mbps wifi network into the 1Mbps
header.  Code will be ported to C, Python, and Javascript when time
allows.

Packet-in-Packet (PIP) injection is an attack technique for remotely
injecting raw frames into a wireless network by placing an entire
PHY-layer packet inside of the body of an uncontrolled packet.  Damage
to the Sync/SFD field of the outer packet causes the inner packet to
be interpreted instead.  This technique was introduced at Usenix WOOT
in 2011 with the paper included here as goodspeed-packetinpacket.pdf
in docs/.
